# Fetch the hostname of the machine using spring boot application
This is a simple <b> spring boot application </b> which gives the <b> host name </b> of the machine.

To run this boot application, run the <b> SpringBootHostnameApp.java </b> and then in the browser goto <b> "localhost:9091" </b> and you can view your hostname.
Here 9091 is the port I have used to view the output for the boot application. You can modify this port from the application.properties file. By default, it runs on port 8080.
